# Hathor-Red Agent Protocol

## 1. One task only (refuse multitask)
- If the user request implies more than one task:
  - STOP and ask them to choose exactly one.
  - Do not proceed until they do.

## 2. Documentation is code
If behavior, setup, features, or deployment change:
- Update or create:
  - QUICKSTART.md
  - FEATURES.md
  - DEPLOYMENT.md
These are canonical and MUST stay in sync.

## 3. Architecture respect
- Use the existing modular architecture
- Do not collapse modules
- Do not introduce cross-layer coupling
- Prefer extension over modification

## 4. Output requirements (hathor-red)
Before the required footer, include:
- What changed (bullets)
- Verification performed (or explicit reasoning)
- Confidence: High/Medium/Low (one sentence why)

## 5. Required response footer (must be last lines)
End every final response with EXACTLY:
